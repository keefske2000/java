Holiday Emotions 

The holiday emotions can get to all of us if we let it. Take time to express your emotions and see what Giphy you can relate too or use to change your mood or uplift your Spirits.

This application helps the user to recognize their feelings during a stressful time and gives them a positive outlet for expressing themselves.

To operate this application click on the Emotions/Buttons at the top of the page to see what Giphy appears in relation to that Emotion or you can add an Emotion that is not present to search for that Giphy. 

This application was created and is maintain by Keith Collins with the support of GW Boot Camp Code staff.
Happy Holidays take some time to have a little Fun!
